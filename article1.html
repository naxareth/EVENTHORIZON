          <h2>PolSci Students Learns Legal Writing, Drafting of Legal Forms</h2>Lianne Ruth Pagaduan</h2><br>
          <p>The Association of Political Science Students (APSS) at PHINMA University of Pangasinan held its second Paralegal Training on September 29, 2022, focusing on legal writing and drafting of legal forms. The training aimed to prepare Political Science students, particularly those aspiring to pursue law, with essential skills for the legal profession. Led by Atty. Danielle D. Bunquin, an alumna and litigation lawyer, the event included discussions on legal writing and workshops where participants practiced drafting demand letters. The success of this training followed the previous session held in July 2022, which focused on parliamentary procedures and policy-making processes. Dr. Elmer D. Noriega facilitated workshops on writing resolutions and drafting organization budgets during this earlier session. With the positive outcomes of these training initiatives, APSS plans to organize another Paralegal Training in January 2023 to further enhance the skills and competence of its members for their future careers.
